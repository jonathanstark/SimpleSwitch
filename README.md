SimpleSwitch
=============

A simple, animated toggle switch UI widget that works in any browser.

## Notes

SimpleSwitch an example of starting small and agressively enhancing an interface (as opposed to starting with the sexy version and trying to fail gracefully). 

Although you could do so, SimpleSwitch is not really meant to be used directly. It's more of an example from which you are encouraged to pick and choose snippets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Feel free to log issues and I'll address as time allows. 

Cheers!
